## Research Questions

### April 27, 2021

1. How do GitHub Actions workflow files change over time in a single repository (a given repository or a set of repositories)?

    a. At what point in time was GitHub Actions introduced?

    b. At what point in time was GitHub Actions removed (if at all)?

    c. How many jobs are existing?

    d. Classification of jobs being run/What types of jobs are being run?

    e. Overall size over time (number of nodes and edges)

    f. What jobs/actions are added? (User input that gives timeline)

    g. What jobs/actions are removed? (User input that gives timeline)

    h. How different is the configuration file at two distinct points in time (size and contents of diff)

2. What are the similarities and differences between GitHub Actions workflow files across a programming language community?

    a. See above ^ to compare different cohorts of repositories

    b. What is the relationship between criticality and the adoption of GitHub Actions

```
Who cares about these research questions?

- Researchers: Will look at multiple repositories and answer research questions among many samples

  - Gives information about GitHub Actions (little is known)
  - Shows info about configs
  - Show what GitHub Actions are popular (see what is critical, how many maintainers are there etc.)

```
